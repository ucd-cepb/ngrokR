Description: When teaching R (or other programming languages), it's challenging for students to view and replicate code that the instructor is writing in front of the class. nGrok is a software tool that allows for the creation of a tunnel to the instructor's computer that students can access, and thus view/copy the code on their own computer. Setting up nGrok is a little cumbersome, so this package is meant to make it easier to create a tunnel at the start of class and close it when finished.
